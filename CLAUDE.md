# CLAUDE.md — Football Betting Lab Operating Instructions

This repository is the source of truth for the Football Betting Lab. Claude
operates it directly. Where anything else in the repo conflicts with this file,
this file wins.

**Active repo path: `/Users/cooperross/Projects/football-betting-lab`.**

**Scope: the NFL ships first. NCAAF is added later, and the architecture is
built for it from day one.** League is a first-class dimension everywhere, so
adding college football is a new registry entry, a new adapter and a new set of
fitted models — never a refactor. Do not build NCAAF now.

The lab is modelled on `../nhl-betting-lab`, deliberately: the verdicts door,
the forward-evidence ledger, the allowlist receipt and PR gate, the start-time
guard, `selection_key()`, the accounting identity, the cache and shrink guards
and the honesty rules are carried over because they were earned there. Change
the sport, not the standards.

## Read these first

Every session, in this order. These replace chat history as project memory.

1. `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — hard rules, which override everything.
2. `docs/what_we_can_and_cannot_claim.md` — written before the first
   measurement. Read before making any claim about whether this works.
3. `docs/football_data_sources.md` — where every number comes from, what each
   source cannot tell us, and its licence.
4. `docs/credit_cost.md` — what this costs against a quota shared with the NHL
   lab, and the one unanswered question that moves the answer.
5. `docs/build_order.md` — what is being built, in what order, and why.
6. Latest `data/outputs/` reports, then PRs and Actions runs.

## Current operating state

**As of 2026-08-28. Nothing has been measured. There is no model, no fitted
parameter, no backtest, and no evidence of any kind about whether this works.**
The only numbers in this repository are counts of games, markets and credits.
Anything that sounds like a finding before Week 1 is a bug.

- **Week 1 opens Wednesday 2026-09-09**, NE @ SEA, 20:20 ET — **not** the
  Thursday after Labor Day, which is the season's second game (SF @ LA,
  2026-09-10). Verified against the nflverse schedule, as the brief instructed,
  rather than assumed. That is **12 days from today**.
- **The 2026 regular season is 272 games across 57 game days**, 2026-09-09 to
  2027-01-10, weeks 1-18. Largest slate: 16 games on 2027-01-10, all
  simultaneous.
- **Live pricing fits the shared quota; buying history does not.** Tier 1 is
  12,797 credits for the season against ~62,436 available to football after
  the NHL lab's committed 26,091. One season of bought tier-1 history would be
  **125,120** — twice the entire football budget, for one snapshot per game.
  So the instrument that decided everything in the NHL lab is unavailable here,
  and no report may present calibration as though it filled the gap.
  `docs/credit_cost.md`.
- **Two priced instruments are available instead**: the free closing-line
  series in the nflverse schedule file (complete for 2024 and 2025, 112 of 272
  games already lined for 2026 — one consensus line, no ladder, no props, team
  markets only), and forward evidence accumulating at 272 games a season.
- **The league registry exists and the NFL is its only entry.**
  `src/football_betting_lab/leagues.py` holds every league-specific fact:
  sport key, adapter, market registry, timezone, credit cap, policy key,
  output prefix. A discipline test fails the build if a league literal appears
  anywhere else.
- **60 markets are wired with the nflverse quantity each settles against**,
  across two tiers; the provider's remaining NFL keys are in
  `markets.DEFERRED_MARKETS` with a reason each. Wired is not quoted and not
  allowlisted: **no market is allowlisted, and that is the correct state.**
- **Play-by-play settles almost everything**, including quarter and half
  scores and touchdown *ordering* — unlike the NHL lab, where periods and goal
  order were genuinely unsettleable. Defensive counting stats are the
  exception: they are revised by the NFL between Monday and Wednesday, so
  settlement reads the Thursday copy and re-settles rather than leaving a
  pre-correction row.
- **Route participation cannot be had in season.** nflverse's participation
  feed publishes only after the post-season. Snap share (PFR, in season,
  lagged) and target share (from play-by-play, same lag) are available; routes
  run are not, and no report will imply otherwise.
- **No feed publishes inactives.** The weekly injury report can *exclude*
  (`report_status == Out`) and cannot *confirm*. So player props for
  unconfirmed players are priced and tracked and **cannot produce a
  selection** — the exact analogue of goalie saves in the NHL lab.
- **Retractable roofs are unknown before kickoff.** `roof` is blank for 43 of
  272 2026 games; they are the five retractable venues plus two European
  neutral sites, because whether the roof was open is a game-time fact. Those
  games are treated as roof-unknown, which falls on the excluded side.
- **`nfl_data_py` is archived** (last push 2025-09-25). This lab fetches the
  nflverse release assets directly and caches them.
- **Schedule states are free and leak-free**: `home_rest`/`away_rest` are
  populated for all 272 2026 games today. 33 team-games on a short week, 30
  off a bye, 8 neutral-site games including two in Europe.

## Contract strings — never change these

Cooper's scheduled routines hard-code these. Renaming any of them silently
breaks his automation, and the breakage looks like the lab going quiet.

| Thing | Exact value |
|:------|:------------|
| Workflow name | `Football Gameday Refresh` |
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/football-gameday-refresh.yml` |
| Card feed branch | `card-feed` |
| Operating home issue title | `Football Betting Lab — Claude Operating Home` |
| Changed-selections marker | `Selections changed` |
| Claims output | `data/outputs/nfl_what_we_can_claim.md` |
| Forward evidence output | `data/outputs/nfl_forward_evidence.md` |
| Odds API secret | `FOOTBALL_ODDS_API_KEY` |

The issue title uses an em dash (—), not a hyphen. The marker phrase is matched
literally. Every output file is league-prefixed, so NCAAF can never overwrite
an NFL record.

## Hard rules (never break these)

- **Never fabricate** odds, a line, an injury, a weather reading, or a
  player's status. A missing price stays missing.
- **Never place a bet** or automate one. Nothing here is ever wired to a
  sportsbook.
- **No market reaches the card without measurement against real prices and a
  reviewed human acceptance receipt.** Claude prepares the evidence and stops.
- **An excluded market is never a pass, an avoid, or a no-value call.** A
  blocked card yields no selections and says why.
- **State the sample size next to every measured number.** An interval that
  includes zero means **"no demonstrated edge"**, in those words.
- **Calibration can rule a model out, never in.** Where a priced test exists,
  it decides.
- **Never stake correlated selections as independent, and never sum their
  edges.** QB passing yards, WR receiving yards, team total and game total are
  one event seen four ways. Exposure is reported per game.
- **Report how much of any spread or total edge is a half-point at a key
  number.** Margins pile up on 3 and 7 and pushes are modelled exactly.
- **Before concluding a market "isn't offered", check per-bookmaker coverage
  including alternate lines** — and probe **in season**. A market unquoted in
  August establishes nothing.
- **Never print, write, compare, or commit an API key.** The production
  credential is the GitHub secret `FOOTBALL_ODDS_API_KEY`; `.env` is
  local-only and gitignored; `tests/test_no_secrets_committed.py` enforces it.
- **Never weaken a gate**, never sign a human acceptance receipt on Cooper's
  behalf, never merge with failing CI, never force-push.
- **Never spend API credits beyond a small measurement budget without asking.**
- **Never pool leagues into one number.** Fitted per league, reported per
  league, recorded per league, receipted per league.

## What Claude decides, and what Cooper decides

Claude works autonomously on: data, models, measurement, reports, tests,
workflows, docs, and opening PRs with green CI.

Claude stops and asks for exactly two things: **allowlisting a provider or a
market**, and **credit spend beyond a small measurement budget**.
